# Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

This is a Jupyter notebook that aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. Reviewing 4 new potential portfolios, this notebook will provide financial data to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas for each of the funds using the S&P 500 as the base market.

## Usage

To analyze the portfolio risk and return notebook, begin by typing jupyter lab in your terminal. 

```python
jupyter lab
```

Next, find the folder with the notebook(risk_return_analysis.ipynb) and double click it to open it up in a new launcher. Then, begin running through each section of the application to get the appropriate data.

Once in the notebook it will take you through a step-by-step process as it Collects the Data, Prepares the Data, and Analyzes the Data.
You will be granted visualizations along the way to help better see and understand the data.

We do believe everything is thoroughly explained in the notebook, but please let us know if you have any further questions.
